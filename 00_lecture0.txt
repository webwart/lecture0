How to exclude files/directories from the git repository.
:GO:		https://github.com/github/gitignore
:DOWNLOAD:	.gitignore file adpated to your programming langugage
:SAVE:		.gitignore in my git repository (e.g. \dev\CS50\lecture0 )
:ADD:		git add .gitignore
:Commit:	git commit -m "Added .gitignor"  

I can add .gitignore to the repository, but I do not have to. 

The GIT STATUS command shows files, which I have not added to the git repo.

How to define files/directory which I never want to add to my git repo ?
-Use the Explicit repository excludes.

Use your favorite text editor to open the file called .git/info/exclude within the 
root of your Git repository. Any rule you add here will not be checked in, and will 
only ignore files for your local repository.

:NAVIGATE: to the location of your Git repository.
:EDIT:  .git/info/exclude.
